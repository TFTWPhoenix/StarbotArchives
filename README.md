# StarbotArchives
Archive of old starbot versions. (Note: Will not contain version directly previous)

### Notice

You need to install the NPM packages yourself.

### Why am I doing this?

Most of the time Kaboom.pw bot source code is super secret and highly guarded. Starbot is the same. Why am I publishing old source code? Because these versions are old and obsolete. Yeah sure they still work. They just dont work as well as they used to. I am releasing these with the closest license on github to "Do what ya want".

Have fun guys!
